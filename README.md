*"They aren't quite pandas. Manatees, the pandas of the sea."*

Manatee is a wrapper class around PySpark DataFrames. It adds some much needed user-friendliness by providing helper methods to the `pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame` object. It also offers the ability to pair the dataframe with a `pyspark.mllib` classification or regression model, neatly keeping everything in one place.

This project is in pre-alpha.
