*"They aren't quite pandas. Manatees, the pandas of the sea."*

Manatee is a wrapper class around PySpark DataFrames. It adds some much
needed user-friendliness by providing helper methods to the
``pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame`` object. It also offers the ability
to pair the dataframe with a ``pyspark.mllib`` classification or
regression model, neatly keeping everything in one place.

This project is in pre-alpha. Check out the documentation_.
